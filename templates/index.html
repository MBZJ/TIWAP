                This project is a collection of various web vulnerabilities which are found on live websites and arise
                due to lack of secure development policies and testing. Exploiting such vulnerabilities on a live
                website might lead into an investigation if the organization has no vulnerability disclosure program or
                you have gone out of scope. People who are working in this domain for long are aware of everything, but as
                a beginner we don't want you get into anything as such, therefore we bring you a website which you can host
                on your own local system and try all the available attacks and learn to exploit them.
