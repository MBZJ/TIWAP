        <p><b>TIWAP (Totally Vulnerable Web Application Project) web application is designed for Cybersecurity enthusiasts who want to learn Web application security. This application includes various security levels (Low-Medium-High). You can change security levels to practice. The security level changes the vulnerability level of TIWAP.</b></p>
        <div align="justify">
            <p>1. <b>Low -</b> This security level is completely vulnerable and has no security measures at all. We recommend beginners to start with this level. This level is used as an example of how web application vulnerabilities manifest through bad coding practices and to serve as a platform to teach or learn very basic exploitation techniques.</p>
            <p>2. <b>Medium -</b> At this level, basic security measures are taken to avoid the vulnerability but still it is not totally secure, it can be bypassed. This setting is mainly to give an example to the user of bad security practices, where the developer has tried but failed to secure an application. It also acts as a challenge to users to refine their exploitation techniques.</p>
            <p>3. <b>Hard -</b> This option is an extension to the medium difficulty. The developer tried to implement harder and alternative security measures but again failed to completely secure the website. In this level, the users need to refine their exploitation techniques and try harder to exploit the vulnerability.</p>
